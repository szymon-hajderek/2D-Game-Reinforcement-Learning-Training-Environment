# Reinforcement Learning Framework in C++17

A lightweight reinforcement learning framework in C++17, designed to experiment with training agent policies in a 2D environment. The framework provides an abstract agent interface and a minimal 2D game environment to test learning strategies.

The focus of the project:
 - Gaining deeper understanding of reinforcement learning fundamentals
 - Creating a sandbox for experimenting with reinforcement learning algorithms in C++
 - Designing a layer of abstraction between what's rendered and actual environment state
 - Training a tabular Q-learning agent to play a game
